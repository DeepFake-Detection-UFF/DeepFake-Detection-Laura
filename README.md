# DeepFake Detection
## Step 1: Xception
- Image Model
- Platform: Kaggle
- V1: Created the detection algorithm using Xception as the model and see the results;
- V2: Add Grad-CAM as Explainable AI;
- Conclusion: the model should do better previsions.
- Next steps: Improvents to achieve better results
## Step 2: [Liveness Classifier](https://www.kaggle.com/models/kameshrasu/liveness_classifier/)
- Video Model from Kaggle
- Platform: Kaggle
- V1: Created a simple detection script, it should do better previsions
- V2: Apply face extrations using different methods. Improvement in previsions and best results using YOLO, MTCNN and SSD
- V3: Add Xplainable AI, Frequency and Occlusion Sensitivity Analysis
- Next steps: Improve model and face ebbeding
