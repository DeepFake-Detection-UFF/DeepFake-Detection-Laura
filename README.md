# DeepFake Detection
## Step 1: Xception
- Image Model
- Platform: Kaggle
- Created the detection algorithm using Xception as the model and see the results;
- Tried to add Grad-CAM as Explainable AI tool (in progress);
- Conclusion: the model should do better previsions.
## Step 2: Liveness Classifier
- Video Model
- Platform: Kaggle
- Created a simple detection script, it should do better previsions
- Next steps: Extract faces from video
